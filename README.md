# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! In here you will find my study cases and personal projects

There are currently 3 study cases. Each has it's own PDF with the explanation, a .odp file for the presentation of the results, and the code in .py extension. Some cases may have additional archives, like graphs, in .zip format

Case 3 is currently a Work in Progress
