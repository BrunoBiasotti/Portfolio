Project: Log Reader, Parser, and IP counter to make decisions

Given a nginx log, this code reads it and generates a parsed output to write into Excel or DB.
Counts the amount of times an IP repeats and store them in .txt files
With a new execution, the code picks up from the last line read and reads up to the latest line. If the last line is not found because of log rotation, 
 it searches for the old log, reads it till the end, and also reads the new log.
Then compares the lastest execution with the current execution and gather insights on growth and historical maximum for decision making
